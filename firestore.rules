/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Vibee OS Lite.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-related data
 * (profiles, vibes, mood history). Global tags are publicly readable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/vibes/{vibeId}: Vibes, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /tags/{tagId}: Global emotion tags, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/moodHistory/{moodHistoryId}: Mood history, accessible only to the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles, vibes, and mood history.
 * - Global tags are publicly readable to facilitate app functionality.
 * - Listing of user-specific data (vibes, mood history) is allowed only for the owning user.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for schema iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userId` is part of the path for `vibes` and `moodHistory`, allowing direct path-based authorization.
